# Power BI Projects — Interactive Dashboards & Insights

This repository showcases my work in **Power BI**, where I transform datasets into interactive dashboards and meaningful business insights.  
All datasets used in these dashboards come from previous projects I completed in Excel, SQL, or Python — but this repo focuses purely on the **Power BI visualization layer**.
